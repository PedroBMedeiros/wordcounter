Special Instructions for running program:
1) Compile by using "make"
2) "./fw [filename] [filename2]"
3) If specific number of words diplayed is desired, use "-n [num]" in call

Initially I created a working program that did not use the hash table ("original.c"),
but a flat variable size array of pointers. That program is functional but not ideal performance wise.
If you'd like to try it, please rename/replace original.c to fw.c and run make again. 

With the little time left to complete the assignment, I changed the implementation to use a hash table.
Performance is better but I am having a problem with the resizing of the hash map.
That's the solution found on current fw.c.

Therefore, the current code is hardcoded to a large size meaning there is a limit in file size for the program.
With more time that could have been corrected.
